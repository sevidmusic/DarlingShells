# Step 1: Download and verify iso | best to use the magnet torrent provided by arch
#         @ https://www.archlinux.org/download/, though this requires a torrent application
#         like qtorrent, it's the most straight forward download, also its kind to leave
#         the torrent client open after so it can be "seeded" back to others downloading
#         the Arch iso via a torrent client. Final note, downloading iso and sig files from
#         ArchLinux.org as opposed to one of the available mirrors is more secure, so if
#         possible, always get directly from ArchLinux.org
#
# The magnet link will be something like:
#
# magnet:?xt=urn:btih:49da7ae0de8874462471d0f5419b850e599b05ef&dn=archlinux-2020.08.01-x86_64.iso
#
# To verify run the following command:
#
# gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-version-x86_64.iso.sig
#
# Make sure to cd to directory where .iso and .sig files are located, .sig can be
# obtained https:archlinux.org/Downloads
#
# Note: If the gpg command above does not work you may need to obtain the appropriate public key, a google search of the error
#       message output by gpg should bring up reddit/stackoverflow/arch wiki posts with appropriate solutions.
# This stack overflow post may also be helpful: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/594222/verify-archlinux-signature
#
# Step 2: Use dd to erase and foramt a usb drive as ext4, then use the following command to put the iso file on the usb stick
# (!MAKE SURE TO cd INTO DIRECTORY WHERE ISO FILE IS BEFORE RUNNING THIS COMMAND)
# sudo dd if=NAMEOF_ISO of=/dev/NAMEOF_DEVICE status="progress"
#
# Note: Use lsblk to get a list of available devices.
